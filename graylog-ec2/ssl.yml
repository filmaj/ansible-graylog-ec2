# This platbook leverages Let's Encrypt to create an SSL certificate for the
# domain of our Graylog instance. It's important to customize the variables
# below for your own usage!
# Note that this will bounce nginx, as interacting with Let's Encrypt requires a
# delicate dance with nginx.
# Note that the kibana.yml playbook also customizes the nginx config, which
# by default leverages the SSL cert created here.
